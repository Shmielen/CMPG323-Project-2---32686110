# IoT_API

This project contains all the methods needed to initiate my database

I created an API using C#, swagger and Azure.
The tables were imported from my database into my AZURE SQL database.

Users will be able to download my api and make use of it if they think it will be helpful.
All my project resources are saved on Azure. There you will be able to find my SQL database, API management service, App service, and SQL server.
